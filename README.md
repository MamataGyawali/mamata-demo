**Airline-Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis**

**Project Background**

In the highly competitive airline industry, customer satisfaction is crucial for maintaining passenger loyality, enchancing the airline's reputation, and ensuring long-term business success. However, airlines often face challenges in understanding and addressing what causes passenger dissatisfaction. Common concerns among passengers include service quality, comfort, punctuality and overall travel experience.

**Objectives**

The project aims to enchane customer satisfaction and pinpoint areas for improvement by:

* Identifying patterns and characteristics of dissatisfied passengers.

* Performing supervised learning algorithms to predict passenger satisfaction.
  
**Methodology**

**Data Preparation**

 * Source: Data obtained from Kaggle, which contains airline Passenger satisfaction survey.

 * Actions: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

  * Purpose: To discover patterns, spot anomalies and gain a deeper unserstanding of the dataset's characteristics.

  * Technique: Visualization, summary statistics and correlation analysis.

  **Machine Learning**

   * Goals:Build model to predict customer Satisfaction.

   * Approach: 1 algorithm is evaluated to determine the model.

  **Tools**

  * Programming Languahe: Python

  * Libraries: pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn

**Results**

  The analysis revealed that the Logistic Regression model, achieving an accuracy of 72.4%, was the effective in predicting customer 
  satisfaction. By implementing the findings from this project, airlines can make data-driven decisions to refine their services, 
   ultimately 
  leading to higher customer satisfaction, increased loyality, and a stronger competitive position in market.

**Future Work**

  * Model Improvement: Explore more advanced machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.
  * Broader Applications: Extend the analysis to other aspects of airline operationssuch as flight delays and baggage handling, to further 
    enhance customer experience.
